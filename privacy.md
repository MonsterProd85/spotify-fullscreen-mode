# Privacy Policy for Spotify Fullscreen Mode

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data or personal information.

The extension only accesses information already visible on the Spotify Web Player to create a visual fullscreen experience. This includes currently playing track information, album artwork, and Canvas videos.

No information is sent to any server or third party. All processing happens locally in your browser.
